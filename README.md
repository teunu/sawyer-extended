# sawyer-extended
A Stormworks mod to expand and improve upon the sawyer islands. Adding new gameplay oppertunities and details. Only edited and new files have been included.

PLEASE NOTE
This is a in-development mod. I strongly believe community and transparency is required to get the best out of this mod, and feedback is appreciated. Please note however that during dev versions, polish is generally disregarded until specified. I'm very well aware that art and physic are glitchy, and feedback about this isn't helpful. (Again, check if I stated it is a polished version, in those cases i'm happy to receive word).

--how to install--
just drag and drop the contents of this folder into your "./Stormworks" folder.

--Notes--
-This is a greybox, or a rudimentary version to verify positioning, gameplay and other important data. Details previously in the game or planned have been
omitted and will be placed back after an official release.
-Due to the abovementioned reasons, meshes and physics will not be accurate at all, feedback is greatly appreciated, but leave out missing faces and wonky .phys positioning (I'm aware and will go through everything to clean).
-The train tracks stop further inland? ~Yes, sorry for that, I know it's been exciting a lot of people. The reason being that the railway extention is only part of my focus with this mod. I've been made aware of src and people having had 
plans for this already, and I want to communicate with them to avoid conflict.
-As with all mods, framerate or stability might be at risk. Then again, it's stormworks - not a big difference.
-tutorials for mesh/world editing might be coming soon.

--Included--
-Three terminals & a drydock, all with a static editor for whatever you need to specialize in as player
	-A ~ Train terminal (two vehichles)
	-B ~ Cargo terminal 1 (medium naval)
	-C ~ Cargo terminal 2 (large naval)
	-Drydock (small naval)
-A customisable player base plot
-Extended tracks leading inland (stops before the visuals)

--Future plans--
-Stormworks extended aims to get the world of stormworks be more responsive to the player, and act more like a true sandbox rather than a backdrop for the amazing vehicles the community produces. 
	This is done by:
	-Adding detail to the world to improve (re)playability and reaping the intrinsic rewards of exploration, including towns and hub extensions.
	-Allowing for logistical puzzles with static workbenches and more interconnectivity between hubs and terminals
	-Adding challenging terrain to some parts of the sawyers to allow emergent challenges and gameplay. 
	-Giving players more freedom in creativity, by giving them more tools to complete otherwise harder feats.
	-Allowing the mod to be a framework on which other modders can build their missions and modifications.
